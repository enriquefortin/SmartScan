    <h1>The indent-ldap-filter Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Parses a provided LDAP filter string and displays it a multi-line form that makes it easier to understand its hierarchy and embedded components.  If possible, it may also be able to simplify the provided filter in certain ways (for example, by removing unnecessary levels of hierarchy, like an AND embedded in an AND).
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>indent-ldap-filter <i>{arguments}</i> <i>{filter}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--indent-spaces <i>{numSpaces}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the number of spaces that should be used to indent each additional level of filter hierarchy.  A value of zero indicates that the hierarchy should be displayed without any additional indenting.  If this argument is not provided, a default indent of two spaces will be used.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 0 or greater than 2,147,483,647.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--do-not-simplify</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should not make any attempt to simplify the provided filter.  If this argument is not provided, then the tool will try to simplify the provided filter (for example, by removing unnecessary levels of hierarchy, like an AND embedded in an AND).
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

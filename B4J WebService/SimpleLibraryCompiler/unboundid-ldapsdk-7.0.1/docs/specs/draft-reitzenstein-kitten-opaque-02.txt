A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism using the asymmetric password-authenticated
                          key agreement OPAQUE
                  draft-reitzenstein-kitten-opaque-02

Abstract

   This specification describes a Simple Authentication and Security
   Layer (SASL, RFC4422) authentication mechanisms based on the OPAQUE
   asymmetric password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE) protocol.

   The mechanism offers two distinct advantages over the SCRAM family of
   mechanisms.  The underlying OPAQUE protocol provides the ability for
   clients to register without the server having to have access to the
   clear text password of an user, preventing password exfiltration at
   registration.  Secondly a successful authentication produces a long-
   term secret key specific to the user that can be used to access
   encrypted server-side data without needing to share keys between
   clients via side-band mechanisms.

   When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent security layer
   these mechanisms allow for secure channel binding.

1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   This specification describes an authentication mechanism called
   OPAQUE, based on the asymmetric PAKE of the same name.  The
   mechanisms provide strong mutual authentication and allow binding the
   authentication to an pre-existing underlying encrypted transport.

   The mechanism specified in this document is a Simple Authentication
   and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism compatible to the bridge between
   SASL and the Generic Security Services Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) called "GS2" [RFC5801].  This means that the
   mechanism can be used as either a SASL mechanism or a GSS-API
   mechanism.

   The OPAQUE algorithm provides the following features which this
   mechanism makes use of:

   *  The authentication information stored in an authentication
      database on the server is not sufficient to impersonate the
      client.  It is additionally salted and bound to a private key of
      the server, making pre-stored dictionary attack impossible.

   *  Successful authentication does not grant the server enough
      information to impersonate the client.

   *  Mutual authentication is implicit and required.  A successful
      authentication always strongly authenticates both sides of the
      exchange.

   *  A successful authentication provides both parties with an
      ephemeral shared secret.  This secret has high entropy and can be
      used to establish a trusted encrypted channel without deriving
      trust from a 3rd party.

   *  A successful authentication additionally provides the client with
      a constant secret.  This secret is only known to the client and
      the same for every authentication.  It can be used to e.g. store
      encrypted data on the server without having to manage keys
      locally.

3.  OPAQUE Algorithm Overview

   The Authenticated Key Exchange defined by OPAQUE consists of three
   messages -- KE1, KE2 and KE3 -- send by the client (KE1, KE3) and
   server (KE2) respectively.  A client knows the outcome of the
   authentication after receiving KE2, the server after receiving KE3.

   The following is a description of a full SASL OPAQUE-A255SHA
   authentication exchange.  Nothing in OPAQUE-A255SHA prevents sending
   the first client response with the SASL authentication request as
   defined by an application protocol ("initial client response").  See
   [RFC4422] for more details.

   The OPAQUE client starts by being in possession of an username and
   password.  It uses the password to generate a KE1, and sends this
   message and the username to the server.

   The server retrieves the corresponding authentication information,
   i.e. registration record, OPRF seed, server private key, and the key-
   stretching function (KSF) parameters that were used at registration.
   It uses the first three to generate a KE2 message as per [OPAQUE] and
   sends that, channel binding data (if any) and the KSF parameters to
   the client.

   The client authenticates the server using KE2 and the KSF parameters,
   also showing the integrity of the channel binding data in the
   process, and generates a final KE3 message it can return to the
   server.

   The three messages KE1, KE2 and KE3 are generated using the following
   functions specified in [OPAQUE] with the configuration specified in
   Section 5:

 KE1 := ClientInit(password)

 KE2 := ServerInit(
          server_identity, server_private_key, server_public_key,
          record, credential_identifier, oprf_seed, KE1, client_identity
        )

 KE3 := ClientFinish(client_identity, server_identity, KE2)

   The values of client_identity and server_identity are set to the byte
   sequences:

   client_identity := client-first-message + "," + client_public_key

   server_identity := server-message-bare + "," + server_public_key

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


   With the values and encodings of the remaining parameters per the
   OPAQUE specification, client_- and server_public_key being encoded as
   raw bytes, and + indicating concatenation.

   Upon receipt of KE3 the server can validate the authentication
   exchange including integrity of the channel binding data it sent
   previously, and extract a session key that strongly authenticates the
   client to the server.

4.  OPAQUE Mechanism Name

   The name of the mechanism specified in this document is "OPAQUE-
   A255SHA" or "OPAQUE-A255SHA-PLUS" respectively.  The "-PLUS" suffix
   is only used when the authenticating parties support and intent to
   use channel binding.  If the server supports channel binding it
   SHOULD advertise both the bare and the plus version of this
   mechanism.  If the server does not it will only advertise the bare
   version.

5.  OPAQUE-3DH configuration for OPAQUE-A255SHA(-PLUS)

   The OPAQUE-3DH configuration according to Section 7 of [OPAQUE] used
   by the OPAQUE-A255SHA mechanism is made up of the following
   cryptographic primitives:

   *  OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512) as specified in Section 4.1 of
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf-17]

   *  HKDF [RFC5869] using SHA-512 as KDF

   *  HMAC [RFC2104] using SHA-512 as MAC

   *  SHA-512 as Hash

   *  Argon2id [RFC9106] as KSF, with the remaining parameters being set
      during an authentication exchange

   *  The same ristretto255 group used by the OPRF as Group

   *  The ASCII-String "SASL-OPAQUE-A255SHA" as Context

   Implementations of this mechanism SHOULD default to Argon2id
   parameters of (t=1, p=4, m=2^21).

6.  OPAQUE Authentication Exchange

   An example of an OPAQUE-A255SHA authentication exchange consisting of
   three messages, send by the client, server and client respectively:

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


   C: n,,n=user,r=<ke1>
   S: c=biws,i=bT0yMDk3MTUyLHQ9MSxwPTQ=,v=<ke2>
   C: p=<ke3>

   First, the client sends the "client-first-message" containing:

   *  A GS2 header consisting of a flag indicating channel binding
      support and usage, and an optional SASL authorization identity.

   *  The authentication ID (AuthID) of the user.

   *  OPAQUE KE1, containing the OPRF credential request, a nonce, and
      an ephemeral public key.

   In response the server sends the "server-message" containing:

   *  An encoding of requested channel binding data

   *  Parameters for the KSF that needs to be used by the client

   *  OPAQUE KE2, containing the OPRF credential response, a nonce, and
      an ephemeral public key.

   *  A MAC proving the integrity of the exchange so far and
      cryptographically authenticating the server to the client (also
      contained in KE2)

   The client then recovers a client-only export key and a shared secret
   specific to this session from the OPRF response using the defined KSF
   with the user-provided password and parameters sent by the server.

   To finalize the authentication a client sends a "client-final-
   message" containing itself a MAC over the exchange (in KE3), thus
   cryptographically authenticating the client to the server.

6.1.  OPAQUE Attributes

   This section details all attributes permissible in messages, their
   use and their value format.  All Attribute keys are a single US-ASCII
   letter and case-sensitive.  The selection of letters used for
   attribute keys is based on SCRAM [RFC5802] to make it easier to adapt
   extensions defined for SCRAM to this mechanism.

   The order of attributes is fixed for all messages, except for
   extension attributes which are limited to designated positions but
   may appear in any order.  Implementations MUST NOT assume a specific
   ordering of extensions.

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


   *  a: This is an optional attribute and is part of the GS2 [RFC5801]
      bridge between GSS-API and SASL.  Its specification and usage is
      the same as defined in [RFC5802], Section 5.1.

   *  n: This attribute specifies the name of the user whose password is
      used for authentication (aka "authentication identity" [RFC4422]).
      Its encoding, preparation, and usage is the same as defined in
      [RFC5802], Section 5.1.

   *  m: This attribute is reserved for future extensibility.  In this
      version of OPAQUE its presence in a client or server message MUST
      cause authentication failure when the attribute is parsed by the
      other end.

   *  r: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE1 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  c: This REQUIRED attribute specifies the base64-encoded GS2 header
      and channel binding data.  Its specification is the same as
      defined in [RFC5802], Section 5.1, however it is sent by the
      server to the client instead of the other way around as in SCRAM.

   *  i: This attribute specifies base64-encoded parameters for the KSF
      to be used.  The format of the parameters is specific in
      Section 6.1.1.

   *  v: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE2 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  p: This attribute specifies a base64-encoded serialization of the
      KE3 message as specified by [OPAQUE].

   *  Further as of now unspecified mandatory and optional extensions.
      Mandatory extensions are encoded using the "m" attribute, optional
      attributes may use any unassigned attribute name.  Unknown
      optional attributes MUST be ignored upon receipt.

6.1.1.  KSF parameter encoding

   The Argon2id [RFC9106] algorithm as used by OPAQUE-A255SHA requires
   the three parameters t, p, and m to be additionally transferred from
   server to client for an authentication exchange.  The values for
   these parameters are fixed at registration time, but may be different
   for each user.


   // Note: Argon2 may get a PKCS#5 parameter encoding, e.g.
   // https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/issues/348 ; should we

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


   // wait on that or specify our own format?
   //
   // -- Nadja

   The limits and interpretation of the parameters set in [RFC9106]
   apply.  Parameters are encoded as a sequence of ASCII key-value pairs
   separated by ASCII commas.  The key and value in each pair are
   separated by a single ASCII equals sign ('=').  The keys for the
   parameters are the single letter identifiers assigned by [RFC9106],
   the values are encoded as decimal numbers with no digit delimiters or
   separators.

   Example of the encoding of the parameters number of passes = 1,
   degree of parallelism = 4 and memory size = 2 GiB (i.e. 2^21 KiB)
   using the above rules:

   m=2097152,t=1,p=4

6.2.  SASL Mechanism Requirements

   This section describes the required information for SASL mechanisms
   as laid out in [RFC4422], Section 5.

   1) "OPAQUE-A255SHA" and "OPAQUE-A255SHA-PLUS"

   2a) OPAQUE is a client-first mechanism

   2b) OPAQUE does not send any additional data to indicate a successful
   outcome.  All authentication exchanges take 3 messages regardless of
   success.

   3) OPAQUE can transfer authorization identities from the client to
   the server.

   4) OPAQUE does not offer security layers but allows channel binding.

   5) OPAQUE uses a MAC to protect the integrity of the entire
   authentication exchange including the authzid.

7.  Channel Binding

   OPAQUE supports binding the authentication to an underlying secure
   transport.  Support for channel binding is optional, therefore the
   usage of channel binding is negotiable.

   The negotiation of channel binding is performed as defined in
   [RFC5802], Section 6 with the following differences:




von Reitzenstein Čerpnjak Expires 20 July 2023                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


   *  The non-PLUS and PLUS variants of the mechanism are instead named
      OPAQUE-<variant> and OPAQUE-<variant>-PLUS respectively.

   *  As it is the server who sends the channel binding data the client
      is responsible to verify this data by constructing the expected
      value of the "c=" attribute and comparing it to the received one.
      This comparison SHOULD be implemented to be constant-time.

7.1.  Default Channel Binding

   'tls-exporter' is the default channel binding type for any
   application that do not specify one.

   Servers MUST implement the 'tls-exporter' [RFC9266] channel binding
   type if they implement any channel binding and make use of TLS-1.3
   [RFC8446].  Clients SHOULD implement the 'tls-exporter' [RFC9266]
   channel binding type if they implement any channel binding and make
   use of TLS-1.3.

   Server and clients SHOULD implement the 'tls-unique' [RFC5929]
   channel binding if they implement channel binding and make use of
   TLS-1.2.  If a server or client implements 'tls-unique' they MUST
   ensure appropriate protection from the [TripleHandshake]
   vulnerability using e.g. the Extended Master Secret Extension
   [RFC7627].

   Servers MUST use the channel binding type indicated by the client, or
   fail authentication if they do not support it.

8.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification is written in Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].  The non-
   terminals "UTF8-2", "UTF8-3" and "UTF8-4" are defined in [RFC3629].

   The syntax is based in large parts on [RFC5802], Section 7, which may
   be referenced for clarification.  If this specification and [RFC5802]
   are in conflict, this specification takes priority.

   Used definitions from [RFC5802] are reproduced here for convenience:

   ALPHA = <as defined in RFC 5234 appendix B.1>
   DIGIT = <as defined in RFC 5234 appendix B.1>
   UTF8-2 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>
   UTF8-3 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>
   UTF8-4 = <as defined in RFC 3629 (STD 63)>

Internet-Draft            OPAQUE Authentication             January 2023


9.  Security Considerations

   The KSF parameters and channel bindings aren't authenticated before
   KSF usage, allowing a DoS of a client by an malicious actor posing as
   the server, as it can send excessively expensive KSF parameters.

   If not used with a secure channel providing confidentiality this
   mechanism leaks the authid and authzid of an authenticating user to
   any passive observer.

   The cryptographic security of this mechanism is not increased over
   the one provided by the underlying OPAQUE protocol, so all security
   considerations listed in the [OPAQUE] specification also apply to
   this one.

10.  Open Issues

   *  With the current design the KSF parameters can not be MAC-verified
      until after they have been used.  This is bad.  The only other
      option is using the ephemeral keypair to generate a MAC key and
      use that.  This may impact security.

   *  This mechanism should be extended to also become a GSS-API
      mechanism like SCRAM is.

11.  IANA Considerations

   A future revision of this document will request a new registry for
   the OPAQUE family of SASL mechanism, outlining all required details
   on the primitives used by the 'OPAQUE-A255SHA' variant.
